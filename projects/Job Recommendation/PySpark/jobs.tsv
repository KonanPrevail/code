1495	1	Executive Recruiter	<p></p>\r<p>www.iscjobs.com, International Search Consultants, inc. Â is growing and we are looking to add a few new good recruiters to our team.Â  Even though it is a virtual position, the majority of our recruiters are based in Arizona, so AZ residents are especially encouraged to apply. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>This is a sub-contractor, 1099 position.Â </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><strong>There will be a background check done prior to inviting anyone to join our team.</strong> </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>You will work virtual, and be responsible for providing a land line and an internet connection. ISC Â will pay for all other overhead, including 800#, access to all job boards, and tons of extra tools to help you be successful. We do offer training for folks with no recruiter training but it is <em>minimal</em>...definitely looking for someone who is self motivated and can work independently. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>For the firstÂ month you will be focused strictly on NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT...cold calling into companies, using our sourcing tools to give you contact info, and then calling in, attempting to gain new job orders. After roughly one month you will then be either working job orders that you have developed yourself, or working on house accounts. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>We also have positions for strictly New Business Development for the right person. Straight commission, we need someone who understands that this is a long sales cycle and can realistically go for the first few months with no paycheck. After typically 3 months your pipeline fills up and then the cks can be pretty consistent, however it never changes from being a straight commission position. In 2012 the biggest single commission ck for one month so far has beenÂ  $34k. Extremely high earning potential, this is not for the weak of heart! Big dollars, you can make $10k in a day, and lose it in a day if deal falls thru, candidate accepts counter-offer, etc. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>Looking for someone who wants to be in charge of their own destiny. Extremely high earning potential, 6-figures is definitely possible in this position, but it does take a full time person who can handle the ups and down of this brutal but exhilarating business. THIS IS A FULL CYCLE RECRUITING POSITION....YOU WILL BE FINDING YOUR OWN JOB ORDERS, FILLING THEM, ETC. We provide full resources and the tools for you to succeed, but you will be responsible for procuring your own job orders in addition to working on house accounts. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p></p>\r<p><strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ISC's Mission Statement:Â </strong></p>\r<p><strong></strong></p>\r<p style="text-align: center"><strong>To make as much money as humanly possible, while maintaining the highest levels of ethics and integrity with a minimal level of drama. </strong></p>\r<p style="text-align: center"><strong></strong></p>\r<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>More Money, Less Drama!</em></strong></p>	<p>Revised Requirements: <br />\r<br />\rNO prima donnas, divas, psychos or cry babies, or anyone with an attitude of ENTITLEMENT, rather than GRATITUDE, Â puhleeze, do not apply. <br />\r<br />\rIf you haveÂ ever had friends of family describe you as someone with extreme mood swings, <strong><em>PLEASE</em></strong> do not apply.Â  Anyone who has been diagnosed with even aÂ "Mild' personality disorderÂ  will not find long-termÂ  satisfaction within our group. <br />\r<br />\rIf you are prono to hysterical outbursts during stressfulÂ  situations...like straight commission deals,Â and have ever been in a team environment and had anyone tell you that you are 'snippy',Â 'sharp' or 'rude', 'unreasonably defensive' or 'paranoid', PUHLEEEEZE,Â  do not apply.Â <br />\r<br />\rÂ Â <br />\r<br />\rWE are a team of supportive, NICE recruiters who place a high value on having a pleasant team atmosphere, with no negativity. <br />\r<br />\rLooking for someone who fits into that mold.Â  We are looking for someone who understands this is a straight commission job, with a long sales cycle. Working virtual, hours are flexible but we still need someone who can realistically put in 40 hours a week. They can be flexible hours, but the hours still need to be put in, in order to build the momentum needed to be successful at this.Â </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>Confident on the phone, must have good computer skills.

The first 90Â  days you are planting your crops, knowing that with lots of care and attention, you will be able to reap the rewards of your effortsÂ down the line.Â </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>'Butterfly catchers' need not apply. Someone who expects or needs immediate rewards for their work efforts would not do well in this.Â </p>\r<p></p>\r<p></p>\r<p>MANDATORY...<span style="text-decoration: underline">MUST be able to effectively communicate on-line</span>. If people are constantly replying back to you, saying they do not understand your note, this is NOT for you. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>However, if you are an effective communicator on the phone and on e-mail, are pleasant and money motivated, understand that you can make six figures doing this but that it takes someone who is willing to CONSISTENTLY put in 40 hour weeks, will not break down in tears/hives/spasms when deals fall apart :o), e-mail me and we will go from there.
